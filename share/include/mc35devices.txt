# dev = device name
# program = program memory in 14 bit words
# data = data memory in bytes
# eeprom = eeprom storage
# enhanced = 0 | 1
#   0: regular device (default)
#   1: indicate that this is an enhanced core (automatic context saving on IRQ)
# io = io lines
# maxram = maximum memmap address for unique general purpose registers
# bankmsk = mask for memmap bank selecting. 0x80 for two banks usable, 
#           0x180 for four.
# config = white-space separated list of config word addresses
# regmap = registers duplicated in multiple banks. First value is a bank bitmask,
#          following values are register addresses
# memmap <start> <end> <alias>
#	<start> - <end> mirrored in all banks set in <alias>
#	<alias> is a bitmask of bank bits (0x80, 0x100, 0x180)
#	Make sure to always provide at least one non-full (<alias> = <bankmsk>)
#	record or SDCC will assume that all usable memory is shared across all
